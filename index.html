        <h1>My First 2C-B Experience</h1>
        <p>It’s my first time experience with 2C-B. Though I had some basic knowledge about it—its chemical structure and how it works—I had my mindset prepared for it. But it was all theoretical; the practical was something else.</p>

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>The trip began unexpectedly. I came back from work with 2C-B and LSD in my pocket, hanging out with two of my close buddies. We were casually talking about trying it out in two days, but the idea of sampling a small dose tonight came up. Before I knew it, we all agreed. We divided the powder into three lines—50 mg, 35 mg, and 16 mg. I went for the highest, thinking I was ready for it.

            Right after snorting the line, my nose felt like it was on *hellfire*. My dealer had warned me that snorting 2C-B would be harsh, but this was intense. After a minute, I could still feel the burn. I turned to my friend and said, “Man, it’s starting.” I could feel tears welling up, not because of emotions but because of the intense burn. My mind started racing, wondering if I was bleeding, so I went to the bathroom to check. I rinsed my nose with cold water, almost gagged, and asked my friend, “Am I bleeding?” But no, it was all just in my head.
            
            We returned to the room, and I tried to shift my focus away from the burning sensation. That’s when everything around me began to *turn fluid*. God bless my buddy—he did everything he could to keep me calm as I started to panic a little, telling him, “Bro, I thought I was ready for this, but this dose is high!” And that was just the beginning.
            
            As the pain eased, I realized I was hitting my *peak. I felt like I had **forgotten everything: who I was, where I was, and what we were doing. I lost all sense of reality. Nothing made sense. Sounds and visuals collided and blended into each other, and my mind felt like a blank slate. It was a bit like **ego death*, in my own way. Yet, it felt incredible. Slowly, I tried to piece together my surroundings.</p>

        <h2>The Peak</h2>
        <p>Everything melted around me, bending in every direction. If I lost focus, it felt like I was tripping *alone, even though my friends were right there. I couldn’t shake off the feeling that my senses were being **fooled—my hands looked distorted, my phone felt heavy and then suddenly tiny, and I couldn’t read a single word. Everything was moving too fast and in a **fluid* way.

            At the same time, the *MDMA side of 2C-B* kicked in. I was *laughing uncontrollably*, talking non-stop, and saying whatever popped into my head, whether it made sense or not. I told my friend, “Can you check if I’m bleeding? Or can you check if I’m peeing?” because my senses were so twisted, I couldn’t trust them. I had to rely on my friend’s judgment for simple things like that.
            
            But, despite all the confusion, the *visuals were mind-blowing. I couldn’t stop looking around in awe. We kept repeating a line from Bhasker: “Beauty around you is a direct reflection of beauty within you.” It felt like the visuals were echoing that thought, morphing into even more **beautiful shapes* as we talked about it.
            
            Every touch felt *extraordinary. I found myself touching random objects, running my fingers over anything I could find, marveling at how **amplified* the sensations were. One of the best moments was when we played *Lofi music* in the background. The room was white—white blankets, white wallpaper—and suddenly, I was in an *anime world, where everything looked like a **sketch*. It was short, but it felt so real.
            
            We started playing with our hands, making *random shapes, and floating them around. It was so much fun! My friend Kat’s clothes looked trippy, and her glasses kept shifting shape. But after a while, I couldn’t look at anyone’s face; it was too much. People’s faces seemed like they were **falling apart*, and everything was melting around me.</p>

        <h2>After the Peak</h2>
        <p>After that intense peak, the effects started to ease. I was still *tripping hard*, but I could finally laugh about it. We started a thought experiment: “If you were the last person on Earth, what would you do?” I quickly answered, “Bro, I’d find all the psychedelics, take them all together, and disappear with the world!” We brainstormed for a while about how to survive and find drugs when alone on Earth. It was hilarious!

            I also felt a deep sense of *gratitude* the entire time. I kept apologizing to my friend, saying, “Man, I’m sorry if I’m being a burden. I don’t want to trouble you.” But he was so patient and supportive, always telling me, “Bro, just chill.” I realized how *ideal* the environment was, being around people with a similar mindset and who understood psychedelics.
            
            Finally, I went outside for a walk. Everything looked *beautiful and peaceful*, like a softer, more stable version of my LSD visuals. It was less intense, but the world still shimmered with beauty. And I can’t believe we made a single joint last two hours during those chaotic moments. It’s a small thing, but it was funny to me.
            
            Overall, it was a *continuous journey of self-exploration and playful chaos*. It was my first time tripping this hard, and I’ll never forget how transformative and intense it was. Thanks for taking the time to read my story. I hope it brings some insight and joy. And if I remember anything more, I’ll be sure to add it.
            
            *Happy tripping!*</p>
