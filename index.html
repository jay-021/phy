        <h1>My First 2C-B Experience</h1>
        <p>It‚Äôs my first time experience with 2C-B. Though I had some basic knowledge about it‚Äîits chemical structure and how it works‚ÄîI had my mindset prepared for it. But it was all theoretical; the practical was something else.</p>

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>The trip began unexpectedly. I came back from work with 2C-B and LSD in my pocket, hanging out with two of my close buddies. We were casually talking about trying it out in two days, but the idea of sampling a small dose tonight came up. Before I knew it, we all agreed. We divided the powder into three lines‚Äî50 mg, 35 mg, and 16 mg. I went for the highest, thinking I was ready for it.

            Right after snorting the line, my nose felt like it was on *hellfire*. My dealer had warned me that snorting 2C-B would be harsh, but this was intense. After a minute, I could still feel the burn. I turned to my friend and said, ‚ÄúMan, it‚Äôs starting.‚Äù I could feel tears welling up, not because of emotions but because of the intense burn. My mind started racing, wondering if I was bleeding, so I went to the bathroom to check. I rinsed my nose with cold water, almost gagged, and asked my friend, ‚ÄúAm I bleeding?‚Äù But no, it was all just in my head.
            
            We returned to the room, and I tried to shift my focus away from the burning sensation. That‚Äôs when everything around me began to *turn fluid*. God bless my buddy‚Äîhe did everything he could to keep me calm as I started to panic a little, telling him, ‚ÄúBro, I thought I was ready for this, but this dose is high!‚Äù And that was just the beginning.
            
            As the pain eased, I realized I was hitting my *peak. I felt like I had **forgotten everything: who I was, where I was, and what we were doing. I lost all sense of reality. Nothing made sense. Sounds and visuals collided and blended into each other, and my mind felt like a blank slate. It was a bit like **ego death*, in my own way. Yet, it felt incredible. Slowly, I tried to piece together my surroundings.</p>

        <h2>The Peak</h2>
        <p>Everything melted around me, bending in every direction. If I lost focus, it felt like I was tripping <span class="highlight">alone</span>, even though my friends were right there. I couldn‚Äôt shake off the feeling that my senses were being fooled...</p>

        <h2>After the Peak</h2>
        <p>After that intense peak, the effects started to ease. I was still tripping hard, but I could finally laugh about it. We started a thought experiment: ‚ÄúIf you were the last person on Earth, what would you do?‚Äù I quickly answered...</p>
